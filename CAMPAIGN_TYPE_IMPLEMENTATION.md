# Campaign Type Implementation

## Overview
Added a required `campaign_type` field to campaigns to enable grouping, filtering, and analytics.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Database Migration
**File**: `database/migrations/2025_01_24_000000_add_campaign_type_to_campaigns_table.php`

Added `campaign_type` ENUM column with values:
- education
- feeding_program
- medical
- disaster_relief
- environment
- animal_welfare
- other (default)

**To run migration:**
```bash
cd capstone_backend
php artisan migrate
```

### 2. Campaign Model
**File**: `app/Models/Campaign.php`

- Added `campaign_type` to `$fillable` array

### 3. Campaign Controller
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/CampaignController.php`

Updated validation rules in both `store()` and `update()` methods:
```php
'campaign_type' => 'required|in:education,feeding_program,medical,disaster_relief,environment,animal_welfare,other'
```

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Create Campaign Modal
**File**: `components/charity/CreateCampaignModal.tsx`

- Added `campaignType` to form state (default: "other")
- Added "Type of Campaign" dropdown with all predefined types
- Included `campaign_type` in API submission
- Updated reset function to include campaign_type

**UI Location**: Between "End Date" and "Donation Type" fields

### 2. Campaign Type Options
The dropdown displays user-friendly labels:
- Education
- Feeding Program
- Medical
- Disaster Relief
- Environment
- Animal Welfare
- Other

## Verification Steps

1. **Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd capstone_backend
   php artisan migrate
   ```

2. **Create a Campaign**:
   - Log in as charity admin
   - Open "Create Campaign" modal
   - Fill in all required fields
   - Select a campaign type from the dropdown
   - Submit the form

3. **Verify in Database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, title, campaign_type FROM campaigns ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```

4. **Check API Response**:
   - GET `/api/campaigns/{id}` should include `campaign_type` field
   - GET `/api/charities/{id}/campaigns` should show campaign_type for all campaigns

## Future Enhancements

1. **Filtering**: Add campaign type filter in campaign list pages
2. **Analytics**: Create reports grouped by campaign type
3. **Icons**: Display type-specific icons on campaign cards
4. **Stats Dashboard**: Show breakdown of campaigns by type
5. **Search**: Enable search/filter by campaign type on public pages

## API Examples
