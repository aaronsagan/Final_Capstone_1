## üìã Overview
Replaced the free-text "Beneficiaries" field with a structured, multi-select **Beneficiary Category** system to enable:
- Better campaign analytics
- Donor filtering by beneficiary type
- Data-driven insights on who campaigns are helping

---

## ‚úÖ FRONTEND CHANGES COMPLETED

### 1. Constants File Created
**File:** `src/constants/beneficiaryCategories.ts`

Defines all beneficiary categories organized into 6 groups:
- **Education & Youth:** Students, Out-of-school youth, Teachers & schools, Educational institutions
- **Health & Medical:** Patients in hospitals, Children with disabilities, Elderly individuals, People with chronic illnesses
- **Poverty & Hunger:** Low-income families, Homeless individuals, Malnourished children, Rural communities

- **Emergency & Relief:** Disaster-affected families, Conflict/displacement victims, Flood/typhoon survivors
- **Advocacy & Social Causes:** Women empowerment, LGBTQ+ support, Indigenous peoples, Senior citizens

**Helper Functions:**
- `getBeneficiaryLabel(value)` - Get label from value
- `getBeneficiaryGroup(value)` - Get group from value
- `ALL_BENEFICIARY_OPTIONS` - Flat list for validation

### 2. Create Campaign Form Updated
**File:** `src/components/charity/CreateCampaignModal.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Replaced `beneficiary` (string) with `beneficiary_category` (array)
- ‚úÖ Added multi-select dropdown with Command + Popover components
- ‚úÖ Displays selected categories as removable Badge chips
- ‚úÖ Grouped dropdown with searchable options
- ‚úÖ Updated form state and submission logic
- ‚úÖ Styled consistently with CharityHub theme (dark background, yellow accents)

**UI Features:**
- Click to open categorized dropdown
- Checkboxes for multi-selection
- Search/filter functionality
- Badge chips showing selected categories with X to remove
- Helper text: "Select who will benefit from this campaign"
- Count indicator: "X categories selected"

### 3. Campaign Analytics - Beneficiary Breakdown
**File:** `src/pages/charity/Analytics.tsx`

**New Section Added to Distribution Tab:**

**Beneficiary Breakdown Card** includes:
1. **Pie Chart:**
   - Shows campaign distribution by beneficiary type
   - Labels display count and percentage
   - Hover tooltips with detailed info
   - Smooth animations

2. **Top Beneficiaries List:**
   - Ranked list (up to 10)
   - Progress bars showing relative distribution
   - Pink color theme matching the Heart icon
   - Scrollable if many categories

3. **Insight Summary:**
   - Highlights most served beneficiary group
   - Shows total number of beneficiary groups supported

**Data Computation:**
- Processes `beneficiary_category` arrays from campaigns
- Aggregates counts per category
- Sorts by frequency (most common first)
- Updates dynamically when campaigns change

---

## üîß BACKEND CHANGES REQUIRED

### 1. Database Migration
**Add field to campaigns table:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE campaigns 
ADD COLUMN beneficiary_category JSON NULL;
```

**Or in Laravel migration:**
```php
Schema::table('campaigns', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->json('beneficiary_category')->nullable();
});
```

### 2. Campaign Model Update
**File:** `app/Models/Campaign.php` (or equivalent)

```php
protected $casts = [
    'beneficiary_category' => 'array',
    // ... other casts
];

protected $fillable = [
    'title',
    'description',
    // ... other fields
    'beneficiary_category',
];
```

### 3. API Validation
**Campaign Create/Update Controllers:**

```php
$validated = $request->validate([
    // ... other rules
    'beneficiary_category' => 'nullable|array',
    'beneficiary_category.*' => 'string|max:100',
]);

// Optional: Validate against predefined list
$allowedCategories = [
    'students', 'out_of_school_youth', 'teachers_schools',
    'educational_institutions', 'patients_hospitals',
    'children_disabilities', 'elderly_individuals',
    'chronic_illness', 'low_income_families', 'homeless',
    'malnourished_children', 'rural_communities',
    'environmental_conservation', 'stray_animals',
    'endangered_species', 'farming_communities',
    'disaster_affected', 'conflict_victims',
    'flood_typhoon_survivors', 'women_empowerment',
    'lgbtq_support', 'indigenous_peoples', 'senior_citizens'
];

$request->validate([
    'beneficiary_category.*' => Rule::in($allowedCategories),
]);
```

### 4. API Responses
**Ensure campaign responses include beneficiary_category:**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Education for All",
  "beneficiary_category": ["students", "out_of_school_youth"],
  ...
}
```

### 5. Filtering Query (For Donor Side)
**Campaign List Endpoint - Add beneficiary filter:**

```php
// In CampaignController
public function index(Request $request)
{
    $query = Campaign::query();

    // Filter by beneficiary category
    if ($request->has('beneficiary')) {
        $query->whereJsonContains('beneficiary_category', $request->beneficiary);
    }

    return $query->paginate(15);
}
```

### 6. Analytics Query (Optional Backend Aggregation)
**If you want backend-computed analytics:**

```php
// Get beneficiary breakdown
public function beneficiaryBreakdown()
{
    $campaigns = Campaign::where('charity_id', auth()->user()->charity_id)
        ->whereNotNull('beneficiary_category')
        ->get();

    $breakdown = [];
    foreach ($campaigns as $campaign) {
        foreach ($campaign->beneficiary_category as $category) {
            $breakdown[$category] = ($breakdown[$category] ?? 0) + 1;
        }
    }

    return response()->json($breakdown);
}
```

        {opt.label}
      </SelectItem>
    ))}

## üìù DATA EXAMPLES

### Campaign with Beneficiaries

{
  "id": 15,
  "title": "Support Students in Need",
  "description": "Help underprivileged students access education",
  "beneficiary_category": [
    "students",
    "out_of_school_youth",
    "low_income_families"
  ],
  "target_amount": 50000,
  ...
}
```

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STEPS

1. **Deploy Frontend Changes:**
   - New constants file
   - Updated CreateCampaignModal
   - Enhanced Analytics page

2. **Run Database Migration:**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

3. **Update API Documentation:**

## üîÑ MIGRATION STRATEGY

### For Existing Campaigns
**Option 1: Leave null** (campaigns without beneficiaries remain null)

**Option 2: Migrate old text field** (if you had previous beneficiary text):
```php
// One-time migration script
Campaign::whereNotNull('beneficiary')->each(function($campaign) {
    // Parse old text and map to categories (manual or AI-assisted)
    $campaign->beneficiary_category = ['students']; // example
    $campaign->save();
});
```
