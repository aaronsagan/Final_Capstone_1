# ✅ Analytics Errors FIXED!

## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **500 Error on `/api/analytics/campaigns/trending`**
**Problem:** SQL GROUP BY error - selecting `campaigns.*` but only grouping by `campaigns.id`

**Fix:** Updated `trendingCampaigns()` method to explicitly list all non-aggregated columns in both SELECT and GROUP BY clauses:
```php
->groupBy('campaigns.id', 'campaigns.title', 'campaigns.charity_id', 
          'campaigns.campaign_type', 'campaigns.target_amount', 'campaigns.current_amount')
```

### 2. **404 Errors on Missing Endpoints**
**Problem:** Frontend was trying to fetch endpoints that didn't exist

**Fixed by Adding:**
- ✅ `GET /api/analytics/summary` - Overall metrics (campaigns, donations, total raised)
- ✅ `GET /api/analytics/campaigns/locations` - Campaign distribution by region
- ✅ `GET /api/analytics/campaigns/temporal` - Monthly trends (campaigns & donations)
- ✅ `GET /api/analytics/campaigns/fund-ranges` - Distribution by funding goal ranges
- ✅ `GET /api/analytics/campaigns/top-performers` - Top campaigns by amount & progress
