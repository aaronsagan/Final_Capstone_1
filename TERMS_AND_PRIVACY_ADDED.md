# Terms of Service and Privacy Policy Pages Added âœ“

## What Was Created

I've created separate Terms of Service and Privacy Policy pages for both Donors and Charities, with all the content you provided, properly formatted without numbers.

### Files Created:

1. **`src/pages/legal/DonorTerms.tsx`** - Terms of Service for Donors
2. **`src/pages/legal/DonorPrivacy.tsx`** - Privacy Policy for Donors
3. **`src/pages/legal/CharityTerms.tsx`** - Terms of Service for Charitable Organizations
4. **`src/pages/legal/CharityPrivacy.tsx`** - Privacy Policy for Charitable Organizations

## Formatting Changes Applied

As you requested, I removed all the numbers (1., 2., 3., etc.) and made the section titles **bold** using `<h2>` tags:

### Before (with numbers):
```
1. Acceptance of Terms
2. The Platform's Role
3. Your Responsibilities as a Donor
```

### After (bold titles, no numbers):
```
**Acceptance of Terms**
**The Platform's Role**
**Your Responsibilities as a Donor**
```

## Routes Added

Added the following routes to `App.tsx`:

```tsx
{/* Legal Routes */}
<Route path="/legal/donor/terms" element={<DonorTerms />} />
<Route path="/legal/donor/privacy" element={<DonorPrivacy />} />
<Route path="/legal/charity/terms" element={<CharityTerms />} />
<Route path="/legal/charity/privacy" element={<CharityPrivacy />} />
```

## Registration Pages Updated

### Donor Registration (`RegisterDonor.tsx`):
- Links now point to `/legal/donor/terms` and `/legal/donor/privacy`
- Added `target="_blank"` to open in new tab

### Charity Registration (`RegisterCharity.tsx`):
- Links now point to `/legal/charity/terms` and `/legal/charity/privacy`
