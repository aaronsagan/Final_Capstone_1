- Added date casting for `start_date` and `end_date` fields

#### Campaign Controller
**File:** `capstone_backend/app/Http/Controllers/CampaignController.php`

- **store()** - Added validation for `donation_type` (required), `start_date`, `end_date`
- **update()** - Added full validation and support for all new fields including image upload

### 3. Frontend Service Layer

  - `getCampaign()` - Fetch single campaign
  - `createCampaign()` - Create with FormData for image upload
  - `updateCampaign()` - Update with FormData support
  - `deleteCampaign()` - Delete campaign
- Includes proper authentication token handling

   - Proper error handling with user feedback

4. **Enhanced UI**

### 5. API Endpoints Used

- **Campaign Duration:** Can be ongoing or long-term
- **Example:** "Monthly Educational Support Program"

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework:** Laravel 10+ with Sanctum authentication
- **Validation:** Laravel form requests with custom rules
