  <Textarea description />
  <Select donationType />
  <Select status />
  <Input targetAmount />
  <Input image />
  <Input startDate />
  <Input endDate />
</Dialog>
```

**After:**

/>

  formData.append('beneficiary_category[]', category);
});
formData.append('region', data.region);
formData.append('province', data.province);
formData.append('city', data.city);

## 🔄 **How It Works**

### **1. Opening Edit Modal**

```typescript
// User clicks Edit button on a campaign
handleEdit(campaign) → setSelectedCampaign(campaign) → setIsEditDialogOpen(true)
```

### **2. Loading Campaign Data**

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (open && campaign) {
    // Fetch full campaign details
    const fullCampaign = await campaignService.getCampaign(campaign.id);
    
    // Pre-fill form with existing data
    setForm({
      title: fullCampaign.title,
      description: fullCampaign.description,
      problem: fullCampaign.problem,
      solution: fullCampaign.solution,
      outcome: fullCampaign.expected_outcome,
      beneficiary_category: fullCampaign.beneficiary_category,
      // ... all other fields
    });
    
    // Fetch and pre-select donation channels
    const channels = await fetch(`/campaigns/${campaign.id}/donation-channels`);
    setSelectedChannelIds(channels.map(ch => ch.id));
  }
}, [open, campaign]);
```

### **3. Validation & Submit**

```typescript
// Validate all required fields
validate() {
  - Title required
  - Description required
  - Problem >= 50 chars
  - Solution >= 50 chars
  - Outcome 30-300 chars (optional)
  - Target amount > 0
  - At least 1 beneficiary category
  - Region, Province, City, Barangay required
}

// Submit updates
handleSubmit() {
  1. Validate form
  2. Update campaign via API
  3. Update donation channels via attach endpoint
  4. Show success message
  5. Close modal
  6. Refresh campaigns list
