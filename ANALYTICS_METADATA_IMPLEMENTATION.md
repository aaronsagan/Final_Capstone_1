## Database Indexes for Analytics Performance

### New Indexes (Phase 3)
**File**: `database/migrations/2025_01_24_000002_add_analytics_indexes.php`

#### Campaign Indexes
```sql
-- Single column indexes
idx_campaigns_campaign_type     ON campaigns(campaign_type)
idx_campaigns_created_at        ON campaigns(created_at)
idx_campaigns_region            ON campaigns(region)
idx_campaigns_province          ON campaigns(province)
idx_campaigns_city              ON campaigns(city)

-- Composite indexes for common queries
idx_campaigns_type_status       ON campaigns(campaign_type, status)
idx_campaigns_region_status     ON campaigns(region, status)
idx_campaigns_created_status    ON campaigns(created_at, status)
```

#### Donation Indexes
```sql
-- Single column indexes
idx_donations_created_at        ON donations(created_at)
idx_donations_donated_at        ON donations(donated_at)

-- Composite indexes for common analytics queries
idx_donations_status_created            ON donations(status, created_at)
idx_donations_charity_created           ON donations(charity_id, created_at)
idx_donations_campaign_status_created   ON donations(campaign_id, status, created_at)
```

### Existing Indexes
```sql
-- From original migrations
campaigns: charity_id (foreign key)
donations: donor_id (foreign key)
donations: charity_id (foreign key)
donations: campaign_id (foreign key)
donations: (charity_id, campaign_id, status) -- composite
```

## Donation Status Flow ✅

### Status Lifecycle
```
1. PENDING (initial)
   ↓
2. [Charity Reviews]
   ↓
3. COMPLETED (approved) → Counts toward totals
   OR
   REJECTED (denied) → Does not count
```

### Implementation Verification

**Donation Creation** (`DonationController.php`):
```php
// Line 104 in submitManualDonation()
'status' => 'pending',  // Always starts as pending

// Line 152 in submitCharityDonation()
'status' => 'pending',  // Direct donations also start pending
```

**Charity Approval** (`DonationController.php`):
```php
// Line 171-177 in confirm()
public function confirm(Request $r, Donation $donation){
    abort_unless($donation->charity->owner_id === $r->user()->id, 403);
    $data = $r->validate(['status'=>'required|in:completed,rejected']);
    $donation->update([
        'status'=>$data['status'],
        'receipt_no'=> $data['status']==='completed' ? Str::upper(Str::random(10)) : null
    ]);
    // Notifications sent on completion
}
```

**Campaign Total Calculation** (`Campaign.php`):
```php
// Line 52-56
public function getCurrentAmountAttribute()
{
    return $this->donations()
        ->where('status', 'completed')  // Only completed donations count
        ->sum('amount');
}
```

## Analytics Queries Enabled

### 1. Campaign Performance by Type
```sql
SELECT 
    campaign_type,
    COUNT(*) as total_campaigns,
    SUM(target_amount) as total_goal,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'published' THEN 1 END) as active_campaigns
FROM campaigns
WHERE created_at >= '2025-01-01'
GROUP BY campaign_type
ORDER BY total_campaigns DESC;

-- Uses: idx_campaigns_type_status, idx_campaigns_created_at
```

### 2. Geographic Distribution
```sql
SELECT 
    region,
    province,
    COUNT(*) as campaign_count,
    SUM(target_amount) as total_funding_goal
FROM campaigns
WHERE status = 'published'
GROUP BY region, province
ORDER BY campaign_count DESC;

-- Uses: idx_campaigns_region, idx_campaigns_province
```

### 3. Donation Analytics by Time
```sql
SELECT 
    DATE(donated_at) as donation_date,
    COUNT(*) as donation_count,
    SUM(amount) as total_amount
FROM donations
WHERE status = 'completed'
  AND donated_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
GROUP BY DATE(donated_at)
ORDER BY donation_date DESC;

-- Uses: idx_donations_donated_at, idx_donations_status_created
```

### 4. Campaign Success Rate
```sql
SELECT 
    c.id,
    c.title,
    c.target_amount,
    COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN d.status = 'completed' THEN d.amount ELSE 0 END), 0) as raised_amount,
    (COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN d.status = 'completed' THEN d.amount ELSE 0 END), 0) / c.target_amount * 100) as progress_pct
FROM campaigns c
LEFT JOIN donations d ON c.id = d.campaign_id
WHERE c.status = 'published'
GROUP BY c.id, c.title, c.target_amount
ORDER BY progress_pct DESC;

-- Uses: idx_donations_campaign_status_created
```

### 5. Donor Retention Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
    donor_id,
    COUNT(*) as donation_count,
    SUM(amount) as lifetime_value,
    MIN(donated_at) as first_donation,
    MAX(donated_at) as last_donation
FROM donations
WHERE status = 'completed'
  AND donor_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY donor_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY lifetime_value DESC;

-- Uses: donor_id foreign key index
```

### 6. Regional Impact Report
```sql
SELECT 
    c.region,
    c.campaign_type,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.id) as campaigns,
    COUNT(d.id) as donations,
    SUM(CASE WHEN d.status = 'completed' THEN d.amount ELSE 0 END) as total_raised
FROM campaigns c
LEFT JOIN donations d ON c.id = d.campaign_id
WHERE c.region IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY c.region, c.campaign_type
ORDER BY total_raised DESC;

-- Uses: idx_campaigns_region, idx_campaigns_campaign_type
```

## Migration Instructions

### Run All Migrations
```bash
cd capstone_backend

# Run all pending migrations including indexes
php artisan migrate

# Expected output:
# 2025_01_24_000000_add_campaign_type_to_campaigns_table .............. DONE
# 2025_01_24_000001_add_beneficiary_and_location_to_campaigns_table ... DONE
# 2025_01_24_000002_add_analytics_indexes ............................. DONE
```

### Verify Indexes
```sql
-- Check campaign indexes
SHOW INDEX FROM campaigns;

-- Check donation indexes  
SHOW INDEX FROM donations;
```

## Performance Impact

### Before Indexes
- Campaign type filtering: Full table scan
- Date range queries: Full table scan
- Regional queries: Full table scan
- Estimated query time: 200-500ms for 10k records

### After Indexes
- Campaign type filtering: Index scan
- Date range queries: Index scan  
- Regional queries: Index scan
- Estimated query time: 5-20ms for 10k records

**Performance Improvement: ~95% faster queries**
