# ✅ Fund Usage CRUD - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

## 🎯 What Was Done

I've enhanced the **existing** Fund Usage tab in `CampaignPage.tsx` (the public campaign page) with full CRUD functionality for charity owners while keeping it read-only for donors.

---

## 🧹 Cleanup

### **Removed Mock Draft:**
- ❌ Deleted `CampaignFundUsageTab.tsx` (charity admin version)
- ❌ Deleted `FundUsageModal.tsx` (old modal)
- ❌ Removed Fund Usage tab from charity admin dashboard
- ✅ Kept only the existing public campaign page implementation

---

## ✅ Features Implemented

### **1. Real Backend Integration**
- ✅ Fetches fund usage from `/campaigns/{id}/fund-usage`
- ✅ Displays real data from `fund_usage_logs` table
- ✅ Shows 6 seeded records (₱35,500 total)
- ✅ No mock or hardcoded data

### **2. CRUD Operations (Charity Owners Only)**

#### **Create:**
- ✅ "Add Expense" button (visible only to charity owner)
- ✅ Opens modal with form:
  - Category dropdown (supplies, staffing, transport, operations, other)
  - Amount input (₱)
  - Date picker (max: today)
  - Description textarea
  - File upload (receipts/proofs)
- ✅ POST to `/campaigns/{campaignId}/fund-usage`
- ✅ Live update after creation

#### **Read:**
- ✅ Displays all fund usage records as cards
- ✅ Each card shows:
  - 📦 Category icon + name
  - 💰 Amount (₱ formatted)
  - 📅 Date spent
  - 📝 Full description
  - 📎 Attachment link (if exists)
- ✅ Visible to both charity owners and donors

#### **Update:**
- ✅ Edit button on each card (charity owner only)
- ✅ Opens modal with pre-filled data
- ✅ PUT to `/fund-usage/{id}`
- ✅ Live update after editing

#### **Delete:**
- ✅ Delete button on each card (charity owner only)
- ✅ Confirmation dialog
- ✅ DELETE to `/fund-usage/{id}`
- ✅ Live removal from list

### **3. Dynamic Right Sidebar**

The sidebar now changes based on the active tab:

#### **Story Tab:**
- Progress card
- Donate button
- Donation channels

#### **Updates Tab:**
- Progress card
- Update Stats card

#### **Fund Usage Tab:**
- **Spending Summary** card:
  - Total Spent: ₱35,500.00
  - Total Records: 6
  - By Category breakdown
- **Recent Entries** card:
  - Last 3 fund usage records
  - Category, amount, date

#### **Supporters Tab:**
- Supporter Stats card
- Donation channels

## 🔐 Authorization

### **Charity Owner Detection:**
```typescript
const isCharityOwner = user?.role === 'charity_admin' && user?.charity?.id === campaign?.charity.id;
```

### **Conditional UI:**
- ✅ "Add Expense" button: Charity owner only
- ✅ Edit buttons: Charity owner only
- ✅ Delete buttons: Charity owner only
- ✅ Fund usage cards: Everyone (read-only for donors)

### **Backend Security:**
- ✅ Authorization checks in controller
- ✅ Only charity owner can Create/Update/Delete
- ✅ Returns 403 Forbidden if unauthorized

## 📁 Files Modified

### **Frontend:**
1. ✅ `src/pages/campaigns/CampaignPage.tsx` - Enhanced with CRUD
2. ✅ `src/components/campaign/FundUsageFormModal.tsx` - NEW modal for add/edit

### **Backend:** (Already exists from previous implementation)
1. ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/FundUsageController.php` - CRUD endpoints
2. ✅ `routes/api.php` - API routes
3. ✅ `database/seeders/FundUsageSeeder.php` - 6 test records
