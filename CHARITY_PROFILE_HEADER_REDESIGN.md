# Charity Profile Header Redesign

## Issues Fixed
1. **Charity name hard to see** - Name was positioned over dark cover image with poor contrast
2. **Bad spacing** - Elements were cramped and poorly aligned
3. **Poor placement** - Avatar overlapping cover, buttons not well positioned
4. **Stat cards hard to read** - Subtle colors with poor contrast

## Improvements Made

### Layout Changes
- ✅ **Moved header to card background** - Now on a solid background instead of overlapping the cover image
- ✅ **Better avatar positioning** - Larger shadow, better border, positioned with proper negative margin
- ✅ **Improved spacing** - Added proper padding and gaps between elements
- ✅ **Responsive layout** - Better mobile and desktop layouts

### Typography & Visibility
- ✅ **Larger charity name** - Increased from `text-2xl md:text-3xl` to `text-3xl md:text-4xl`
- ✅ **Better text color** - Using `text-foreground` for maximum contrast
- ✅ **Word breaking** - Added `break-words` to handle long charity names
- ✅ **Better badge styling** - More prominent verified badge with white text

### Stat Cards Enhancement
- ✅ **Gradient backgrounds** - Added beautiful gradients (green, blue, purple)
- ✅ **Better borders** - Changed from subtle borders to bold `border-2`
- ✅ **Improved contrast** - Darker text colors for better readability
- ✅ **Hover effects** - Added shadow on hover for interactivity
- ✅ **Better dark mode** - Optimized colors for dark theme

### Button Improvements
- ✅ **Following button** - Now shows red background when following (more prominent)
- ✅ **Better positioning** - Buttons aligned properly with flex-shrink-0
- ✅ **Consistent styling** - Improved button variants

## Technical Details

**File Modified:** `capstone_frontend/src\pages\donor\CharityProfile.tsx`

**Key Changes:**
1. Wrapped header in `<div className="bg-card border-b shadow-sm">` for solid background
2. Reduced cover image height: `h-48 md:h-64` (from `h-64 md:h-80`)
3. Adjusted negative margin: `-mt-16 md:-mt-20` (from `-mt-20 md:-mt-24`)
4. Added ring to avatar: `ring-4 ring-background` for better visibility
5. Enhanced stat cards with gradients and better colors
6. Improved responsive breakpoints and flex layouts
7. Better gradient overlay on cover: `bg-gradient-to-b from-transparent to-black/40`

## Fix for Visibility Issue (v2)
- **Problem:** Profile picture, name, and buttons were not visible (overlapping dark cover)
- **Solution:** 
  - Reduced cover image height
  - Reduced negative margin on header
  - Added ring to avatar for better separation
  - Ensured all content is on solid card background

## Testing
1. View any charity profile page
2. Check that the name is clearly visible
3. Verify proper spacing between all elements
4. Test on mobile and desktop views
5. Check both light and dark modes
6. Verify stat cards are easy to read
