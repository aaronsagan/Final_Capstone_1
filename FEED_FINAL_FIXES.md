# Community Feed Final Fixes - Complete ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Share Button Restored
**Issue:** Share button was removed when threads were present

**Solution:**
- Share button is now **always visible** on all posts
- Moved "View Thread" to a separate button below the main actions

**New Layout:**
```
[Like] [Comment] [Share]  ← Always present
[View Thread (X)] ← Only shows if post has threads (collapsible)
```

---

### 2. ✅ Threads Are Now Collapsible
**Issue:** Threads were always expanded

**Solution:**
- Added `expandedThreads` state to track which threads are open
- "View Thread" button toggles thread visibility
- Button shows "View Thread" or "Hide Thread" with chevron icons
- Threads start collapsed by default

**Button States:**
```
[View Thread (3) ▼]  ← Collapsed (click to expand)
[Hide Thread (3) ▲]  ← Expanded (click to collapse)
```

**Features:**
- Full-width outline button below main actions
- Chevron icon indicates state (down = collapsed, up = expanded)
- Smooth toggle animation
- Each post's threads toggle independently

---

### 3. ✅ Heart Icon Stays Red When Liked
**Issue:** Heart icon wasn't staying red after liking

**Solution:**
- Added inline `style` attribute with explicit red color
- Combined with className for double assurance
- Applied to both main posts and thread posts

**Code:**
```tsx
<Heart
  className={`mr-2 h-4 w-4 ${update.is_liked ? "fill-red-500 text-red-500" : ""}`}
  style={update.is_liked ? { fill: '#ef4444', color: '#ef4444' } : {}}
/>
```

**Result:** ❤️ Heart stays bright red when post is liked!
