# ✅ Campaign Page Tabs - FIXED!

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

I modified the **existing** `CampaignPage.tsx` (public campaign page for donors) to:

1. ✅ **Fund Usage Tab** - Now fetches REAL data from backend API
2. ✅ **Dynamic Right Sidebar** - Changes content based on active tab
3. ✅ **Removed All Mock Data** - 100% backend-driven

---

## 📋 Changes Made

### **File Modified:** `src/pages/campaigns/CampaignPage.tsx`

#### 1. Fixed Fund Usage Data Fetching
**Before:** Mock/placeholder data
**After:** Real API call to `/campaigns/{id}/fund-usage`

```typescript
// Now fetches from backend API
const response = await fetch(`${import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL}/campaigns/${id}/fund-usage`, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
});
```

#### 2. Enhanced Fund Usage Tab Display
**Before:** Simple list with progress bars
**After:** Detailed cards showing:
- 📦 Category icons (supplies, staffing, transport, operations, other)
- 💰 Amount (₱ formatted)
- 📅 Date spent
- 📝 Full description
- 📎 Attachment links (proof of expense)

#### 3. Made Right Sidebar Dynamic

**Before:** Same sidebar (Progress + Donation Channels) for ALL tabs

**After:** Different sidebar content per tab:

| Tab | Right Sidebar Shows |
|-----|-------------------|
| **The Story** | Progress Card + Donate Button + Donation Channels |
| **Updates** | Progress Card + Update Stats Card |
| **Fund Usage** | Spending Summary Card (total, categories breakdown) |
| **Supporters** | Supporter Stats Card + Donation Channels |
