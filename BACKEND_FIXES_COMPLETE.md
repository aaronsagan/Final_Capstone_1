# Backend Fixes - Complete Summary

## Overview
Fixed critical backend issues affecting login, profile updates, campaign creation, fund usage logs, and charity posts across all user roles (Donor, Charity Admin, System Admin).

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Login System** ✅
**Problem**: When users logged in, charity admins didn't receive their charity organization data.

**Fix**: Modified `AuthController::login()` method to:
- Load charity relationship data for charity_admin users
- Return complete user object with charity information
- Ensures frontend has all necessary data immediately after login

**File**: `capstone_backend/app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php`
- Lines 218-226: Added charity data loading logic

---

### 2. **User Profile Updates** ✅
**Problem**: Profile updates didn't save to database for all user roles, especially charity organization information.

**Fix**: Enhanced `AuthController::updateProfile()` method to:
- Accept all charity-related fields (organization_name, registration_number, tax_id, mission_statement, description, website, address, region, municipality, nonprofit_category, legal_trading_name)
- Properly map form fields to database columns
- Handle logo and cover image uploads
- Update both User and Charity models
- Return fresh data from database

**File**: `capstone_backend/app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php`
- Lines 253-270: Added validation rules for charity admin fields
- Lines 283-299: Added cover image upload handling
- Lines 304-370: Complete charity data mapping and update logic
- Lines 378-387: Return fresh data with charity relationship

---

### 3. **Charity Organization Updates** ✅
**Problem**: Direct charity updates via CharityController didn't save all fields properly.

**Fix**: Enhanced `CharityController::update()` method to:
- Accept all charity fields with proper validation
- Handle logo and cover image uploads with old file deletion
- Proper error handling and logging
- Return fresh charity data

**File**: `capstone_backend/app/Http/Controllers/CharityController.php`
- Lines 120-188: Complete rewrite with validation, file handling, and error management

---

### 4. **Campaign Creation** ✅
**Problem**: Campaigns weren't being saved to the database.

**Fix**: Enhanced `CampaignController::store()` method to:
- Add proper validation with better error messages
- Handle cover image uploads
- Set default status if not provided
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- Return created campaign with charity relationship

**File**: `capstone_backend/app/Http/Controllers/CampaignController.php`
- Lines 1-8: Added required imports (ValidationException, Log)
- Lines 16-64: Complete rewrite with try-catch, validation, file handling

---

### 5. **Fund Usage Logs** ✅
**Problem**: Fund usage logs weren't being saved to the database.

**Fix**: Enhanced `FundUsageController::store()` method to:
- Add proper validation with size limits
- Handle attachment uploads with better folder organization
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- Return created log with relationships

**File**: `capstone_backend/app/Http/Controllers/FundUsageController.php`
- Lines 1-8: Added required imports (ValidationException, Log)
- Lines 20-72: Complete rewrite with try-catch, validation, file handling

---

### 6. **Charity Posts** ✅
**Problem**: Charity posts weren't being saved properly (already had good implementation).

**Status**: Verified existing implementation is correct
- Proper validation
- Image upload handling
- Notification system for followers
- Error handling

**File**: `capstone_backend/app/Http/Controllers/CharityPostController.php`
- Lines 55-104: Store method already properly implemented

---

### 7. **User Session Data** ✅
**Problem**: The `/me` endpoint didn't return charity data for charity admins.

**Fix**: Modified `AuthController::me()` method to:
- Load charity relationship for charity_admin users
- Ensures consistent data structure across login and session checks

**File**: `capstone_backend/app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php`
- Lines 234-243: Added charity data loading logic

---

## Database Schema Verification

All required tables and columns exist:
- ✅ `users` table with all fields (name, email, phone, password, profile_image, role, status, address)
- ✅ `charities` table with all fields (owner_id, name, acronym, legal_trading_name, reg_no, tax_id, mission, vision, goals, services, website, contact_email, contact_phone, address, region, municipality, category, logo_path, cover_image, verification_status)
- ✅ `campaigns` table with all fields (charity_id, title, description, target_amount, deadline_at, cover_image_path, status)
- ✅ `fund_usage_logs` table with all fields (charity_id, campaign_id, amount, category, description, spent_at, attachment_path)
- ✅ `charity_posts` table with all fields (charity_id, title, content, image_path, status, published_at)

---

## Models Verification

All models have correct fillable fields:
- ✅ `User` model: includes all user fields
- ✅ `Charity` model: includes all charity fields including new ones (acronym, goals, services)
- ✅ `Campaign` model: includes all campaign fields including cover_image_path
- ✅ `FundUsageLog` model: includes all fund usage fields
- ✅ `CharityPost` model: includes all post fields

---

## API Routes Verification

All routes are properly configured:
- ✅ `POST /api/auth/login` - Returns user with charity data
- ✅ `GET /api/me` - Returns current user with charity data
- ✅ `PUT /api/me` - Updates user profile and charity info
- ✅ `PUT /api/charities/{charity}` - Updates charity organization
- ✅ `POST /api/charities/{charity}/campaigns` - Creates campaigns
- ✅ `POST /api/campaigns/{campaign}/fund-usage` - Creates fund usage logs
- ✅ `POST /api/posts` - Creates charity posts

---

## Middleware Verification

Role-based middleware is properly configured:
- ✅ `EnsureRole` middleware exists and works
- ✅ Registered as 'role' alias in bootstrap/app.php
- ✅ Applied to protected routes in api.php

---

## Testing Recommendations

### For Donors:
1. Login and verify user data is returned
2. Update profile (name, phone, address, profile_image)
3. Verify updates are saved in database

### For Charity Admins:
1. Login and verify user + charity data is returned
2. Update profile including organization details
3. Create campaigns with cover images
4. Add fund usage logs with attachments
5. Create charity posts with images
6. Verify all updates are saved in database

### For System Admins:

## File Upload Configuration

Ensure storage is properly configured:
```bash
# Create symbolic link for public storage
php artisan storage:link
```

Storage folders used:
- `storage/app/public/profile_images/` - User profile images
- `storage/app/public/charity_logos/` - Charity logos
- `storage/app/public/charity_covers/` - Charity cover images
- `storage/app/public/campaign_covers/` - Campaign cover images
- `storage/app/public/fund_usage_attachments/` - Fund usage attachments
- `storage/app/public/charity-posts/` - Charity post images
- `storage/app/public/charity_docs/` - Charity documents

---

## Error Logging

All controllers now include comprehensive error logging:
- Validation errors return 422 with detailed error messages
- Server errors return 500 with error details (in development)
- All errors are logged to Laravel log files for debugging

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test the backend API** using Postman or similar tool
2. **Verify database updates** by checking the database after each operation
3. **Test file uploads** to ensure storage is working correctly
4. **Check Laravel logs** at `storage/logs/laravel.log` for any errors
5. **Update frontend** to handle the new response structures if needed

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Storage link not found"
**Solution**: Run `php artisan storage:link` in the backend directory

### Issue: "Permission denied" on file uploads
**Solution**: Ensure `storage/` and `public/` directories have write permissions
```bash
chmod -R 775 storage
chmod -R 775 bootstrap/cache
```

### Issue: "Charity not found" after login
**Solution**: Ensure the user has a charity record in the database with matching owner_id

### Issue: "Validation failed" on updates
**Solution**: Check the validation rules in the controllers and ensure frontend sends correct field names
