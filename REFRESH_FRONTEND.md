# How to See the Changes

## Quick Steps

1. **Hard Refresh Your Browser**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Linux)
   - Or `Ctrl + F5`
   - This clears the cache and reloads

2. **If that doesn't work, restart Vite:**
   - In the terminal running `npm run dev`, press `r + Enter` to restart
   - Or stop it (Ctrl+C) and run `npm run dev` again

3. **Clear Browser Cache Completely**
   - Press `F12` to open DevTools
   - Right-click the refresh button
   - Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

## What You Should See

After refreshing, the Charity Dashboard should have:

✅ **Large hero section** at the top with:
   - Big heading "Charity Dashboard"
   - Subtitle text
   - Two large buttons (Create Campaign, View Donations)
   - Gradient background

✅ **More spacing** everywhere:
   - Bigger gaps between sections
   - More breathing room
   - Less cramped feel

✅ **Better layout**:
   - Stats cards with proper spacing
   - Quick Actions section below
   - Everything aligned nicely

## Troubleshooting

If you still don't see changes:

1. **Check the URL**: Make sure you're at `http://localhost:8081/charity`
2. **Check you're logged in**: As a charity admin account
3. **Check terminal**: Look for any Vite errors
4. **Try incognito mode**: Open a new incognito/private window

## Quick Test

Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
console.log(document.querySelector('h1').textContent);
```

Should show: "Charity Dashboard" (not just "Dashboard")
