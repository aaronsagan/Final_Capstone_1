# Alignment Fix - Quick Testing Guide

## 🎯 What to Test

The alignment fix ensures all charity cards have perfectly aligned bottoms, regardless of description length or content.

---

## 🧪 Quick Visual Test

### Step 1: Open the Charities Page
```
Navigate to: /donor/charities
```

### Step 2: Look for Alignment
**What to check:**
- ✅ All cards in the same row should have the **same height**
- ✅ The stats section (Followers | Campaigns | Raised) should be at the **same Y-position** across all cards
- ✅ The buttons (Donate, Follow, View) should be at the **same Y-position** across all cards

**Visual Guide:**
```
Row 1:
[Card A]    [Card B]    [Card C]
  ↓           ↓           ↓
Stats ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ ← All aligned
Buttons ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ ← All aligned
```

## 🔍 Detailed Test Cases

### Test 1: Short vs Long Descriptions

**Find two cards:**
1. One with a short description (1 line)
2. One with a long description (2 lines, truncated)

**Expected:**
- ✅ Both cards have the same total height
- ✅ Bottom sections (stats + buttons) are perfectly aligned
- ✅ The card with shorter description has more white space in the middle

**Visual:**
```
Short Description:          Long Description:
┌──────────────┐           ┌──────────────┐
│   Image      │           │   Image      │
│   Name       │           │   Name       │
│   Short desc │           │   Long desc  │
│              │           │   that trun..│
│   [SPACE]    │ ← Extra   │              │
│   Stats      │ ← Aligned │   Stats      │ ← Aligned
│   Buttons    │ ← Aligned │   Buttons    │ ← Aligned
└──────────────┘           └──────────────┘
```

   ↓        ↓                ↓        ↓
 Stats    Stats            Stats    Stats
 Buttons  Buttons          Buttons  Buttons

**Action:** Hover over a truncated description (one with "..." at the end)

**Expected:**
- ✅ Tooltip appears after brief delay
- ✅ Shows full description text

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Cards still have different heights
**Cause:** Browser cache or CSS not loaded

**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check DevTools for CSS errors

---

### Issue 2: Hover lift not working
**Cause:** CSS transition not applied

**Solution:**
1. Check browser supports `transform: translateY()`
2. Verify Tailwind CSS is loaded
3. Check for conflicting CSS

---

### Issue 3: Tooltip not appearing
**Cause:** Tooltip component not loaded

**Solution:**
1. Verify `@/components/ui/tooltip` exists
2. Check console for import errors
3. Ensure TooltipProvider is rendered

---

### Issue 4: Mobile layout broken
**Cause:** Grid breakpoints not working

**Solution:**
1. Check viewport meta tag in HTML
2. Verify Tailwind breakpoints are correct
3. Test in actual mobile device, not just browser resize

## 📸 Screenshot Checklist

Take screenshots of:

1. **Desktop 3-column view** - showing aligned bottoms

## 🎬 Video Test (Optional)

Record a short video showing:

1. Scrolling through the charities page
2. Hovering over different cards
3. Showing tooltip on truncated descriptions
4. Resizing browser from desktop → tablet → mobile
5. Demonstrating that alignment is maintained

---

## 🔧 Developer Testing

### Using Browser DevTools:

1. **Inspect Card Heights:**
   ```javascript
   // Open Console and run:
   const cards = document.querySelectorAll('[class*="group overflow-hidden"]');
   const heights = Array.from(cards).map(card => card.offsetHeight);
   console.log('Card heights:', heights);
   console.log('All same?', heights.every(h => h === heights[0]));
   ```

2. **Check Flexbox Layout:**
   - Right-click on a card → Inspect
   - Look for `display: flex` and `flex-direction: column`
   - Verify header has `flex-grow: 1`
   - Verify content has `margin-top: auto`

3. **Verify Grid Layout:**
   - Inspect the grid container
   - Look for `grid-auto-rows: 1fr`
   - Check computed styles show equal row heights
