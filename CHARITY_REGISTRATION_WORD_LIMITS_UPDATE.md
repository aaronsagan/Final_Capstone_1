# Charity Registration - Word Limits Updated ✅

## Changes Made

Updated the character and word limits for charity registration fields to accommodate more detailed content.

### New Limits

| Field | Old Limit | New Limit | Word Capacity |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Mission Statement** | 1,000 characters | 6,000 characters | ~1,000 words |
| **Vision Statement** | 1,000 characters | 6,000 characters | ~1,000 words |
| **Description (About)** | 2,000 characters | 12,000 characters | ~2,000 words |

## What Changed

### Backend (AuthController.php)
```php
// Before
'mission_statement'=>'nullable|string|max:1000',
'vision_statement'=>'nullable|string|max:1000',
'description'=>'nullable|string|max:1000',

// After
'mission_statement'=>'nullable|string|max:6000',
'vision_statement'=>'nullable|string|max:6000',
'description'=>'nullable|string|max:12000',
```

### Frontend (RegisterCharity.tsx)

#### 1. Character Limits
- Mission Statement: **6,000 characters max**
- Vision Statement: **6,000 characters max**
- Description: **12,000 characters max**

#### 2. MaxLength Attributes
Added `maxLength` to all three textareas to prevent typing beyond the limit

#### 3. Increased Textarea Rows
- Mission Statement: 4 rows → **6 rows**
- Vision Statement: 3 rows → **6 rows**
- Description: 8 rows → **12 rows**

#### 4. Word Count Display
Now shows both character count and estimated word count:
```
Example: 2,400 / 6000 characters (~400 words, max 1000 words)
```

## Character to Word Conversion

We use an average of **6 characters per word** (including spaces), which is a standard estimate:
- 1,000 words ≈ 6,000 characters
- 2,000 words ≈ 12,000 characters

## User Experience

### Real-time Feedback
Users can now see:
- Current character count
- Estimated word count
- Maximum allowed characters
- Maximum allowed words

### Example Display
```
Mission Statement: 450 / 6000 characters (~75 words, max 1000 words)
Vision Statement: 300 / 6000 characters (~50 words, max 1000 words)
Description: 1,200 / 12000 characters (~200 words, max 2000 words)
```

### Validation
- Browser prevents typing beyond maxLength
- Backend validates max characters
- Form shows helpful character/word counters

## Benefits
