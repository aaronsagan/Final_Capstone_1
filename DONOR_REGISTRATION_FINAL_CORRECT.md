## 🎯 Why ID Verification is Critical

### Without ID Verification:
- ❌ Fake accounts
- ❌ Scammers can register
- ❌ No way to verify identity
- ❌ Platform trust issues
- ❌ Charities can't trust donors

### With ID Verification:
- ✅ **Real people only**
- ✅ **Government ID required**
- ✅ **Identity verified**
- ✅ **Platform credibility**
- ✅ **Charities trust donors**
- ✅ **Legal compliance**
- ✅ **Prevents fraud**

---

## 🎯 Why Terms at End is Correct

### Terms/Privacy at Start ❌:
- Users don't know what they're agreeing to yet
- They haven't seen what data is collected
- Poor UX - legal stuff first
- Lower conversion

### Terms/Privacy at End ✅:
- **Industry standard** (Google, Facebook, etc. all do this)
- Users see exactly what they're signing up for
- They've provided the data, now they consent
- **Informed consent** - legally stronger
- Better UX - commitment before legal
- Higher completion rate
